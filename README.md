## Introduction

Bacteria detection is a crucial task in various scientific and medical applications. This project aims to build an accurate and efficient object detection model to identify bacteria in images. We utilize the YOLOv8 architecture, which is known for its real-time object detection capabilities.

## Data Preparation

Before training the model, it's important to prepare the dataset. The dataset consists of labeled images containing bacteria instances. The data preparation involves:

- Collecting and organizing the dataset.
- Annotating images with bounding box coordinates for bacteria instances.
- Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Image Augmentation

To enhance the model's ability to generalize, we apply various image augmentation techniques to the training dataset. Augmentation includes operations such as:

- Random flips and rotations.
- Changes in brightness, contrast, and saturation.
- Adding noise and blurring.

Image augmentation diversifies the training data, making the model more robust and capable of handling different variations in input images.

## Training

The YOLOv8 model is trained using the prepared and augmented dataset. The training process involves:

- Configuring YOLOv8 architecture and hyperparameters.
- Feeding the training data to the model.
- Optimizing the model's parameters using backpropagation.
- Monitoring the training progress using loss metrics.
- Saving the best-performing model checkpoints.

Training can take some time, depending on the dataset size, model complexity, and hardware capabilities.

## Results

The trained model's performance is evaluated on the validation and testing datasets. Evaluation metrics include:

- Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- Mean Average Precision (mAP) for overall detection accuracy.
- Visualizations of detection results on sample images.
